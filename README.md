# Project Overview: Calibration and Distortion Correction in Stereotactic Navigation

## Introduction
This project, conducted at the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR) at Johns Hopkins University, focused on advanced calibration techniques and distortion correction within stereotactic navigation systems. Utilizing a combination of 1D, 2D, and 3D interpolation techniques alongside Bezier curves and volumes, we aimed to enhance the precision of tip location determination in CT frames, crucial for medical applications.

## Objectives
- To optimize the calibration process and correct distortions in stereotactic navigation systems.
- Implement interpolation methods to achieve high accuracy in tip location determination.

## Methodology
We employed Bezier curves and volumes for interpolation, ensuring robust calibration and distortion correction. Techniques like tensor-form interpolation polynomials and least squares problem solving were pivotal.

## Challenges and Solutions
We addressed several challenges, including handling distorted data and ensuring accurate tip location determination. Through meticulous mathematical modeling and algorithmic strategies, we succeeded in significantly enhancing system reliability.
